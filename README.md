# Tokenmaxxing Client

Reports your Claude Code and Codex token usage to the [Tokenmaxxing Leaderboard](https://tokenmaxxing.odio.dev). Each user gets a shareable profile page at `tokenmaxxing.odio.dev/user/YOUR_NAME`.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g ccusage            # Claude Code usage reader
git clone git@github.com:srosro/tkmx-client.git
cd tkmx-client && npm install
cp .env.example .env              # then edit .env (see below)
npm run report                    # test it
npm run install-service           # auto-report every 2 hours
```

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

[ccusage](https://github.com/syumarin/ccusage) reads your local Claude Code usage data. Codex CLI usage is auto-detected from `~/.codex/` — no extra setup needed.

```
npm install -g ccusage
```

### 2. Clone and install

```
git clone git@github.com:srosro/tkmx-client.git
cd tkmx-client
npm install
```

### 3. Register your username

Pick a unique username and provide your email. First come, first served.

```
curl -s -X POST https://tokenmaxxing.odio.dev/api/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"YOUR_NAME", "email":"you@example.com"}'
```

Save the returned API key — it cannot be retrieved later.

> Email is required at registration but kept private. It is never displayed or returned by any API.

### 4. Configure `.env`

```
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `USERNAME` | Yes | Your registered username |
| `API_KEY` | Yes | The key returned by `/api/register` |
| `TEAM` | No | Your team name (default: `default`) |
| `TOOLS` | No | What AI coding tools do you actually use daily? (see [Tools, Projects & Communities](#tools-projects--communities)) |
| `PROJECTS` | No | What are you spending tokens on? The projects you're actively building with AI. |
| `COMMUNITIES` | No | What developer communities are you part of? |
| `ABOUT` | No | The main content of your profile — describe your setup, link to tools you use, share blog posts/videos about your workflow. URLs are auto-linked. See [Profile Page](#profile-page) |
| `DEMO_VIDEO_URL` | No | YouTube URL (**3 min or shorter**) showing your before/after AI coding workflow. Embedded on your profile page under "3-MIN DEMO VIDEO". |
| `HN_USERNAME` | No | Your Hacker News username (e.g. `Sam_Odio`). Required to appear on the leaderboard — see [HN Verification](#appearing-on-the-leaderboard-hn-verification) |
| `REPORT_DAYS` | No | Days of history to report (default: `28`). See [Backfill & Optimization](#backfill--optimization) |
| `REPORT_MACHINE_CONFIG` | No | Set to `true` to share machine info (OS, CPU, memory, installed skills, MCP servers, hooks, CLAUDE.md stats, shell/editor) on your profile. No prompts, code, or keys are ever sent. |
| `REPORT_DEV_STATS` | No | Set to `true` to share how you code — tool-call frequencies, session stats, cache efficiency, git outcome metrics (commits/LOC/PRs), and Cursor AI attribution. No file paths, prompts, or code are ever sent. See [Dev Stats](#dev-stats). |
| `CCUSAGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Milliseconds to wait for each `ccusage` run before giving up (default: `180000` = 3 min). Bump if you have a large `~/.claude/projects` tree and see `ccusage ETIMEDOUT`. |

### 5. First run

```
npm run report
```

```
[2026-04-08T12:30:40.544Z] Collecting 28d usage since 20260311 for your-name (team: your-team)
  Claude: 23 days
  Codex: 5 days
[2026-04-08T12:30:44.237Z] Server responded 200: {"ok":true,"rows":56}
```

A `CLIENT_ID` is auto-generated on first run and saved to `.env`. This identifies your machine so multiple machines can report for the same username without overwriting each other.

> **⚠ Don't touch `CLIENT_ID` once it's set.** Usage rows are keyed on `(username, date, model, client_id)` server-side. If you delete `.env`, re-clone into a new directory, or paste a fresh `.env` that omits the line, a new id is generated and the server treats your machine as brand new — the old id's rows stay behind and every overlapping date gets double-counted on your profile. When updating, always `git pull` in place rather than re-cloning. If you must re-clone, copy `CLIENT_ID` from the old `.env` first.

### 6. Install the background service

```
npm run install-service
```

Uses **launchd** on macOS, **systemd** on Linux. Starts immediately, survives reboots, runs every 2 hours.

Verify it's running:

```bash
# macOS
launchctl list | grep token-tracking

# Linux
systemctl --user status token-tracking-reporter.timer
```

## Updating

```bash
cd tkmx-client
git pull
npm install
```

Your existing config (credentials, `CLIENT_ID`) is preserved — `git pull` never touches `.env`. **Do not re-clone or delete `.env` as an "update" — see the CLIENT_ID warning in [First run](#5-first-run).**

### What's new

If you're updating an existing install, refer to the config table above and add any new `.env` values you don't already have:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `REPORT_MACHINE_CONFIG=true` | Shares your machine setup (OS, CPU, memory, installed skills) on your [profile page](#profile-page). **No prompts, code, conversation history, or API keys are ever sent.** |
| `PROJECTS=tkmx,plow.co` | Projects you're building. Shown as badges on your profile and leaderboard. |
| `COMMUNITIES=bloomberg-ai-engineering,agentcribs-community` | Developer communities you're part of. Shown as badges on your profile and leaderboard. |
| `ABOUT="..."` | Bio, config details, and links shown on your profile. Share your setup — blog posts, tweets, or videos where you've discussed your workflow. URLs are auto-linked. |
| `REPORT_DAYS=1` | Only send the last day each cycle instead of 28. Recommended after your first sync. |
| `DEMO_VIDEO_URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...` | YouTube demo video (**3 min or shorter**) embedded on your profile. Show before/after workflows — how you worked before AI tools vs. after. |
| `HN_USERNAME=Sam_Odio` | Your Hacker News username. Required for leaderboard visibility — see [HN Verification](#appearing-on-the-leaderboard-hn-verification). |
| `REPORT_DEV_STATS=true` | Shares how you code — tool frequencies, session stats, cache efficiency, git outcomes, Cursor attribution. See [Dev Stats](#dev-stats). |

`CLIENT_ID` is auto-generated on first run and written to `.env` — you don't need to set it. If you already have one, it's kept as-is.

## Backfill & Optimization

By default the reporter sends 28 days of history. To backfill older data or optimize steady-state reporting:

**Backfill** — set `REPORT_DAYS=365` in `.env` and run once:

```bash
npm run report
```

**Optimize** — after your initial sync, change to `REPORT_DAYS=1` in `.env` so the background service only reports the last day each cycle instead of re-sending 28 days every 2 hours.

You can always do a manual full re-sync by temporarily setting `REPORT_DAYS=28` and running `npm run report`.

## Multiple Machines

The client supports reporting from multiple machines under the same username. Each machine gets its own `CLIENT_ID` (auto-generated on first run), and the server tracks data per-machine. Setup on each machine is identical — just use the same `USERNAME`, `API_KEY`, and `TEAM` in `.env`.

Your [profile page](https://tokenmaxxing.odio.dev) shows how many machines you're reporting from.

### Aggregating from synced remote machines

If you already sync `~/.claude` from other machines to a central location (e.g. via rsync, Syncthing, or a tool like [engineering-notebook](https://github.com/obra/engineering-notebook)), you can aggregate all of them into a single report without installing the client on each machine. Set `EXTRA_CLAUDE_CONFIGS` in `.env` to a comma-separated list of directories, each containing a `projects/` subdirectory of Claude Code JSONL sessions:

```
EXTRA_CLAUDE_CONFIGS=/path/to/synced-laptop,/path/to/synced-desktop
```

The reporter runs `ccusage` once per directory (using `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) and merges the results with the local machine's usage before submitting.

## OpenAI Platform Usage

If you make OpenAI API calls directly (not through Codex CLI), you can pull token usage from `platform.openai.com/usage` and merge it into your reports. This covers any OpenAI API usage — your own scripts, agents, third-party tools authenticated with your API keys, etc.

1. Create an admin API key at [platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys) (must be an Organization Owner). Regular project keys won't work — the org usage endpoint requires an admin key.
2. Add it to `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY=sk-admin-...
   ```
3. Run `npm run report`. You'll see a new `OpenAI platform` line in the output.

The client only *reads* usage data; it never sends your admin key anywhere except `api.openai.com`. Reports use the `/v1/organization/usage/completions` endpoint, which covers chat completions and the Responses API — essentially all OpenAI token volume for most users.

> **⚠️ Don't double-count Codex CLI:** If your Codex CLI is authenticated with an OpenAI API key (rather than a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription), its traffic already appears in platform usage. Enabling `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` alongside Codex collection will double-count those tokens. Leave `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` unset if Codex is on API-key auth.

## Profile Page

Each user gets a shareable profile at `https://tokenmaxxing.odio.dev/user/YOUR_NAME` showing:

- Token usage stats (28-day and all-time)
- Claude vs Codex cost breakdown
- Model breakdown by tokens
- Daily usage chart (28 days)
- Tools, projects, and community badges
- Number of reporting machines
- Your bio from the `ABOUT` field

The `ABOUT` field is the main content of your profile. This is your chance to help other developers by sharing what tools you use and how you use them. Link to the tools, share blog posts, or tweets about your workflow:

```
ABOUT="Building with https://github.com/nickarail/arsenal — 3x founder, shipping AI-first products"
```

URLs are auto-linked on your profile page. The more detail you share, the more useful your profile is to the community.

### 3-Min Demo Video

Set `DEMO_VIDEO_URL` to a YouTube link — **keep it to 3 minutes or shorter**. It embeds on your profile under the "3-MIN DEMO VIDEO" heading. This is the single most useful thing you can share with other developers.

```
DEMO_VIDEO_URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiDcgyAn-88
```

**The goal is one aha moment.** Pick a single concrete task and show how AI has changed the way you do it. Structure it as old world → new world:

- **Old world (~1 min).** One task you used to do before AI. Spell out the friction: the manual steps, how long it took, the parts that made you dread it. Keep this short — the viewer needs enough context to feel the old pain, but not a full re-enactment.
- **New world (~2 min).** The same task today. Show the prompt, the agent's output, the shipped result. Don't cut away from the screen — let people see the actual workflow land. The viewer should finish thinking "I want that."

**Why 3 minutes?** It's a social contract, not a technical check: longer videos get skipped, because nobody owes a stranger more than three minutes to "get" their workflow. The discipline of cutting to 3 minutes is also what forces the demo to be actually good — if you can't show the transformation in that time, the transformation isn't as clear as you thought, and watching a longer cut won't fix it.

## Appearing on the Leaderboard (HN Verification)

To prevent fake accounts, new users must verify a Hacker News account to appear on the leaderboard. Here's how:

1. Set `HN_USERNAME` in your `.env` (e.g. `HN_USERNAME=Sam_Odio`)
2. Run `npm run report` so the server knows your HN username
3. Add your tkmx profile URL to your [HN about section](https://news.ycombinator.com/user). For example, see [Sam_Odio's HN profile](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Sam_Odio) — the about field includes `https://tkmx.odio.dev/user/samodio`
4. Visit your tkmx profile and click "Verify"

HN may cache your about section for a few minutes. If verification fails, wait a minute and try again.

You can still register, report usage, and view your profile without verification — you just won't appear on the public leaderboard.

## Tools, Projects & Communities

Everyone's tweeting about the latest hot AI tool, but most of it is vaporware. By listing what you actually use day-to-day, you help the developer community see what's real and what's hype. Your usage data — backed by actual token spend — shows what tools people are building with in production, not just what they tried once and posted about.

All three fields show as clickable badges on your profile and the leaderboard.

```
TOOLS=superpowers,arsenal
PROJECTS=tkmx,plow.co
COMMUNITIES=bloomberg-ai-engineering,agentcribs-community
```

- **TOOLS** — What AI coding tools do you actually use daily? Only list what you really use, not everything you've tried.
- **PROJECTS** — What are you spending tokens on? The projects you're actively building with AI. Shows up as "building:" on your profile.
- **COMMUNITIES** — What developer communities are you part of? Clickable filters on the leaderboard.

### Known Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [superpowers](https://github.com/nickarail/superpowers) | Claude Code skills for TDD, planning, debugging |
| [arsenal](https://github.com/nickarail/arsenal) | Extended Claude Code skill set |
| [paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) | AI coding agent framework |
| [oh-my-codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex) | Codex CLI enhancements |
| [cmux](https://cmux.com/) | AI coding multiplexer |

## Dev Stats

Set `REPORT_DEV_STATS=true` to share how you actually code. This helps the community learn from top developers' workflows — what tools they use, how they use them, and what they ship.

**What's collected:**

| Category | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Workflow shape** | Tool-call frequencies (Edit, Read, Bash, Grep, Agent, etc.), avg tools per turn, subagent dispatch count, plan-mode entries | Claude Code JSONL transcripts |
| **Session stats** | Sessions/period, avg session length, hour-of-day histogram | Claude Code JSONL timestamps |
| **Cache efficiency** | Cache reuse ratio (cache reads / total prompt tokens) | Claude Code JSONL usage blocks |
| **Git outcomes** | Commits, LOC ±, files changed, PRs opened/merged (aggregate across all repos) | `git log` and `gh` in repos Claude touched |
| **Cursor attribution** | Tab-completion vs composer vs human lines, AI-authored %, conversations by model/mode | `~/.cursor/ai-tracking/ai-code-tracking.db` |

**What's never sent:** file paths, prompt content, tool arguments, repo names, code, commit messages, API keys.

The `REPORT_MACHINE_CONFIG` flag also now includes your configuration stack: MCP server names (no credentials), hook event types, CLAUDE.md size, shell/terminal/editor, and git worktree count.

## Cost Estimation

Cost is calculated server-side using current API pricing:

- **Claude models** — estimated per token type (input, output, cache write, cache read) when ccusage doesn't provide cost. When ccusage reports accurate cost, that's used as-is.
- **Codex models** — estimated using blended rates since Codex only reports total tokens (no input/output split).

You don't need to worry about pricing — the server handles it.

## How It Works

The reporter collects token usage from two sources:

- **Claude Code** via [ccusage](https://github.com/syumarin/ccusage) (`ccusage --json --offline`)
- **Codex CLI** from `~/.codex/state_*.sqlite` (auto-detected, skipped if not present)

Both are merged and POSTed to the Tokenmaxxing server with your API key. Each report replaces previous data for the same machine and date range, so re-syncs are safe and idempotent.
