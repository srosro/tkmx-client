// report.js is a program, not a module — it runs on require (exits on
// missing USERNAME/API_KEY and writes to .env on first run), so there's
// no ergonomic way to unit-test its call-site wiring. Extracting a
// testable body-builder would introduce a lot of surface churn for a
// narrow guarantee.
//
// These grep-style tests guard against the specific regression in the
// original scrubbing bug: reintroducing REPORT_DAYS coupling to the
// rolling-window blob fields (session_stats, cursor_stats), which the
// server stores wholesale and would therefore lose history on short
// REPORT_DAYS runs.

// Grep the TypeScript source, not the compiled output — TS rewrites
// import names (`collectCursorStats` → `cursor_1.collectCursorStats`)
// which would break our patterns. After build, this test lives in
// dist/test/, so the source is two levels up at PROJECT_ROOT/reporter.
